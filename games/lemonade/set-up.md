What you need:

* 2-4 players is ideal, more is possible
* A piece paper and a writing utensil for each player
* At least one 6-sided die
* A way to search Wikipedia

Each player: draw an outline of your character on your piece of paper,
taking no more than a minute. It can look like anything, but leave
lots of empty space!

Each player: choose one starting trait using the Wikipedia pages for
Athletics, Mind, Charisma, or any other page of their choice. The
starting trait has strength 0. Draw the trait onto your character in
some way (see “Traits” for more details).

Collectively, choose a game length (between 5 and 15 recommended).

You’re ready to play!
