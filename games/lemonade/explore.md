Exploring is about storytelling and creativity.

Designate one player as the decision-maker. If this isn’t the first
“explore” step of this game, the decision-maker is whoever had their
event chosen in the previous explore step.

All the other players now take turns describing possible events that
might occur around the characters. On their turn, a player describes

* what their event is,
* how the characters might encounter it,
* how they might use their traits to deal with it, and
* gives the event a difficulty (in general, 1-3 is easy, 4-6 is
  medium, 7+ is hard).

Events can be tasks, opportunities, emergencies, discoveries, and so
on. The descriptions can be done “in character,” a player wants to.

Once all events have been described, the decision-maker chooses one
event to occur.
