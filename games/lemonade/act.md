Acting out the event is about rolling dice and winning tricks.

The number of “tricks” played is equal to the event’s difficulty rating.

Each player will get to roll a 6-sided die for each of their
character’s traits that would affect their character’s actions in the
event. If you can’t explain how a character’s trait would affect the
event, don’t include it.

To play a trick, players take turns clockwise. On your turn, choose
one of your available traits (regular or negative), and roll a die. If
the trait has strength 1, add 1 to the roll. If you wish to “focus” on
this trait, add 1 to the roll (you can only focus on one trait per
event). Once all the players have rolled, roll for the event. If any
of the players rolled for a negative trait and rolled a 1 or a 2, or
the event’s roll is higher than the highest player roll, the event
wins the trick. If no negative traits rolled a 1 or 2 and the players’
highest roll is higher than the event roll, the player with the
highest roll wins the trick.

Once all tricks have been played, if the event won 3 or more tricks,
the players have failed. If the event has won 1 or 2 tricks, the
player(s) who won the most tricks gets a major success, and the other
players get a success. If the event won 0 tricks, all players get a
major success.
