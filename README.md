A metadata driven tabletop RPG Static Book Generator

## The Idea

Build a static generator (like a static site generator) that reads Squad formats and components and generates a table top roleplaying book (or website)

Components are
Paragraphs, texts, images, tables, etc.

They may also have types like
* Rules
* Flavor
* Contexts
* Categories
* Prompts
* Worksheets

Formats specify structured relationships between components
* These rules apply in this context
* This flavor describes these components
* These rules extend those rules
* The components (and their children) should be laid out like this
