text = """Any time a player describes their character doing something
that is covered by a move in the game they must follow the rules
defined by the move (and roll the dice). Any time a player wants the
effects of a move in the game they must describe their character doing
that move (and roll the dice).

Characters cannot do moves without assigning dice to them during
character creation or advancement. A character with dice in a move can
do the move, a character without dice in a move cannot do the move."""

section = "Moves"
text = """The description of a move will always define what dice to
roll and how to intrepret the results by describing how to calculate a
Difficulty rating and a Complexity rating based on choices, and the
situation. Always roll all the unexhausted (see <section exhaustion>)
dice you have in the move and no more. Always roll 6 sided dice.

There are three possible outcomes to any move. It either went well,
went wrong, or went weird. Roll the dice to find out, count up the
number of dice over the difficulty rating, if that's greater than or
equal to the complexity it went well, if it's lower it went wrong
unless it's just one lower, then it went weird. The description of the
move will tell you what happens in each case.

Notation for this is Complexity over Difficulty. For example if a move
has a complexity of 2 and a difficulty of 3 you'd need 2 over 3 for it
to go well, where with exactly 1 over 3 it would go weird and with 0
over 3 it goes wrong"""

of dice that were not over the difficulty up to the complexity

will be exhausted. If all 6 are over 3 nothing is exhausted because
dice over the difficulty can never be exhausted, but if none were over
3 then 2 would be exhausted, because the complexity limits how many
are exhausted. Exhausted dice cannot be roled until they are recovered
through rest. Exhausted stat dice recover with rest listed below, and
moves will describe what rest level is needed to revocer its
dice. Each level recovers everything listed in previous levels"""
